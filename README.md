# Project: Build a ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning (ML) workflow for Scones Unlimited, a fictional bakery, using Amazon SageMaker, AWS Lambda, and AWS Step Functions. The ML workflow will empower Scones Unlimited to streamline operations, predict customer demand, optimize inventory, and improve supply chain management.

## Project Description

**Data Collection:** Gather historical sales data, customer information, and inventory records. This data serves as the foundation for our ML models.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean, preprocess, and transform the data to make it suitable for training ML models. Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features as needed.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover insights in the data. Visualize patterns and relationships that can inform our predictions.

**Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features to enhance the accuracy of ML models. Feature engineering may involve creating lag features, aggregating data over time, or generating customer-specific features.

**Model Selection:** Choose ML algorithms suitable for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supply chain management. This project may involve time series forecasting models, classification models, or regression models.

**Model Training:** Train the selected ML models using historical data. Optimize models by tuning hyperparameters and evaluating performance.

**Lambda Functions:** Implement AWS Lambda functions to handle specific tasks within the workflow, such as data preprocessing and model deployment.

**Step Function Workflow:** Build an AWS Step Function workflow that orchestrates the entire ML process, from data ingestion to model deployment.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), or classification accuracy.

**Deployment:** Deploy trained models on Amazon SageMaker endpoints for real-time predictions.

Continuous Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring and retraining of models to ensure they remain accurate over time.
